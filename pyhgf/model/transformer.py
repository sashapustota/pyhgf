"""A GPT-style Transformer as a mixed pipeline.

Assembles the parts from :mod:`pyhgf.model.hybrid` into the architecture of the
reference Transformer (see ``docs/source/notebooks/0.8-Transformers.ipynb``):
embeddings, repeated blocks of attention and feed-forward sub-layers with normalisation
and shortcut junctions, a final normalisation, and an output head. Any slot can hold a
frozen calculation or a learning PyHGF network; errors travel backward part by part,
with no global backward sweep (see :mod:`pyhgf.model.hybrid` for the conventions and
:mod:`pyhgf.model.fused` for the executor).

The one part specific to Transformers is :class:`MultiHeadAttention`: the only place
where token positions exchange information. Its four weight tables (Q, K, V, O) are
ordinary per-position parts; the *mixing* between them — compare queries against keys,
turn the scores into attention percentages, blend the values — has no weights of its
own, so its role in the backward pass is purely to re-route errors across positions,
using a hand-derived formula (no automatic differentiation).

    """Causal multi-head self-attention as a composite pipeline part.

    Holds four single-input parts for the Q, K, V, and O weight tables (any
    mix of frozen and learning parts) around the weight-free mixing step.
    The query, key, and value projections read the same input, so they can
    instead be one fused part ``wqkv`` whose output stacks the three streams
    on the feature axis, ``[q | k | v]``: the same three linear maps
    computed as one matrix product, with the three routed errors
    concatenated on the way back.
    Operates on ``(batch, seq, features)`` arrays — attention is the one
    part that needs the sequence axis explicit, because it moves information
    *between* positions; everywhere else each position is independent.

    Forward: every position emits a query, a key, and a value through the
    Q/K/V parts; each position's attention scores against the positions it
    may attend to become percentages through a softmax; the values are
    blended accordingly and pass through the O part. ``causal=True`` (the
    default) restricts each position to itself and the earlier ones, as a
    GPT needs; ``causal=False`` lets every position attend to every other,
    as encoder-only models (BERT, ViT, JEPA) need.

    Backward: the error at the output goes back through O, is re-routed
    across positions by the mixing formula (an error at position ``t`` flows
    back to the positions ``t`` attended to, and to the query/key pair that
    set those percentages), and the three resulting messages return through
    Q, K, and V — whose input errors add, since all three read the same
    input.
