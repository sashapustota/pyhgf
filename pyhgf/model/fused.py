"""The pipeline executor: one compiled program per training step.

The classes in :mod:`pyhgf.model.hybrid` and :mod:`pyhgf.model.transformer` *declare* a
model — which slots learn, which are frozen, how parts nest. :class:`FusedPipeline`
runs such a part tree: every part's state (network beliefs, weights, optimiser
moments) enters and leaves as explicit values, and the forward walk, the error at the
output, and every local learning step are staged into a single compiled program —
nothing crosses a compilation boundary inside one training step.

See ``docs/source/notebooks/0.6-Deep_networks_implementation.md`` for the architecture guide and the
verification gates.

Supported part trees: :class:`~pyhgf.model.hybrid.DeepNetworkAdapter`,
:class:`~pyhgf.model.hybrid.EquinoxAdapter`, :class:`~pyhgf.model.hybrid.PCSequential`,
:class:`~pyhgf.model.hybrid.Residual`,
:class:`~pyhgf.model.transformer.MultiHeadAttention`, and the assembled
:class:`~pyhgf.model.transformer.HybridGPT` — the entire Transformer trains in one
compiled call per step.

    Holds every part's mutable state (the network beliefs and weights, the optimiser
    states) as one explicit pytree, and compiles a single step function: forward walk →
    error at the output → backward walk with every local learning step → error at the
    input. The error is formed *inside* the program by ``error_fn``, so no intermediate
    crosses a compilation boundary.

    The part objects only declare the model; they are not advanced while the executor
    runs. Call :meth:`merge` to write the current state back onto them (e.g. to inspect
    a network's layers, or to save it).

    The carried state's buffers are donated to the compiled step, so
    :attr:`state` holds live arrays that the next :meth:`step` consumes:
    anything read from it that must survive a step (a belief to compare
    before and after, a weight snapshot) should be copied first, e.g. with
    ``np.asarray``.

        :class:`~pyhgf.model.transformer.HybridGPT` (whose inputs are then
        integer token ids).
    error_fn :
        How the descent error at the tree's output is formed from the output and the
        training target, e.g. ``lambda out, target: out - target`` for a squared-error
        objective (the default), or
        ``lambda probs, ids: probs - jax.nn.one_hot(ids, vocab)`` for a categorical
        head trained on integer targets. Must be a pure function of arrays.
    error_normalisation :
        How the batch average is normalised when some rows carry no error.

        Every learning part averages its update over the rows it is handed.
        ``"active"`` (default) divides by the number of rows carrying a non-zero error;
        ``"rows"`` divides by the row count.
