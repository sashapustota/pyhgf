    The variable `node_type` encode the type of state node:
    * 0: input node.
    * 1: binary state node.
    * 2: continuous state node.
    * 3: exponential family state node - univariate Gaussian distribution with unknown
        mean and unknown variance.

    The variable `coupling_fn` list the coupling functions between this nodes and the

    ----------
    node_type :
        The type of the state node (see the codes listed above).

        no volatility parent.
