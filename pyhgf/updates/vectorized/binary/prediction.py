    r"""Predict expected mean and precision for a binary state node layer.

    The expected mean is the sigmoid of the weighted, coupled parent predictions:

    .. math::

        \hat{\mu}_b = \sigma\!\left( W \, g(\hat{\mu}_a) \right),

    and the expected precision is the Bernoulli variance:

    .. math::

        \tilde{\pi}_b = \hat{\mu}_b \, (1 - \hat{\mu}_b).

    .. note::

        The ``expected_precision`` field actually stores the **variance** (i.e. the
        uncertainty) of the Bernoulli distribution. Reusing this name avoids the
        need for a separate posterior update step for binary nodes: the continuous
        parent's posterior update can consume the binary prediction error directly.
        Binary leaves carry no AR-volatility random walk, so the conditional
        predicted precision :math:`\hat{\pi}_b` (``conditional_expected_precision``)
        is set equal to :math:`\tilde{\pi}_b` — matching the paper's Limit 3 leaf
        convention used by the parent's posterior-step (smoothing) update.

    Parameters
    ----------
    child_state :
        Current state of the binary child layer (being predicted).
    parent_state :
        Current state of the parent layer (predictor).
    weights :
        Weight matrix connecting child to parent, shape ``(n_children, n_parents)``
        or ``(n_children, n_parents + 1)`` when the parent layer includes a
        constant input node.
    coupling_fn :
        Coupling function applied to parent means (default: :func:`jax.numpy.tanh`).
    parent_has_constant :
        If True, the parent layer has a constant input node (mean = 1.0)
        appended to its activations; the corresponding column of *weights* carries
        the bias connections and is treated as linearly coupled (:math:`g(1) = 1`).

    Returns
    -------
    LayerState
        Updated child layer state with binary expected values.

    # collapsing the level-2 update in high-volatility regimes; a very small value
    # avoids flat, zero-gradient plateaus that hurt gradient-based inference.
